# Overview

This is a wrapper for all the soil spectroscopy ring trial repositories available on [GitHub](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy). The ring trial is a network established by the [Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good](https://soilspectroscopy.org/) to understand the lab-to-lab variability and propose effective solutions for better interoperability. For this, a set of soil standard samples (n=70) were prepared at [Woodwell Climate Research Center](https://www.woodwellclimate.org/) and shipped to several laboratories across five continents. You can learn more about the FT-MIR interlaboratory comparision in this publication:

# Ring trial repositories

- [**ringtrial-preprocessing**](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/ringtrial-preprocessing): code for preparing the MIR returns with preprocessing and spectral standardizaton for further analysis. Spectral harmonization is omitted to avoid publicly disclosing laboratories information.  
- [**ringtrial-eda**](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/ringtrial-eda): code for exploring the instruments variability with visual inspection, PCA projection, correlation spectra, correlation matrices, and dissimilarity analysis.  
- [**ringtrial-modeling**](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/ringtrial-modeling): code for assessing the prediction performance of different instruments.  
- [**ringtrial-metadata**](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/ringtrial-metadata): code for analyzing the metadata of different instruments.
- [**ringtrial-stats**](https://github.com/soilspectroscopy/ringtrial-stats): code for running statistical tests on the variations found of the ring trial instruments.
